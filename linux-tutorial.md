**Linux Tutorial**
The commands are great in the Linux but it is difficult to deal with, though with practice you will be able to understand everything clearly.
We can as many differnt commands on differnt pages as we want which makes it an advantage.
Using differnt terminals is quite easy but you could face a few issues. within every terminal there is a shell and a bash, not to mention being ablw to use shortcuts to write down the codes.

**Basic Linux Navigation**

- The very first command to learn is pwd which stands for print working directory; tells you what your current working directory is.
- The next command is ls the short for list; it will show a plain listinf of your location.
- cd is the next command which means change directory; it moves to another directory.

**More About Linux Files**
- everything under Linux is considered a file even if it was a directory.

- linux format makes all the files attach as many extentions or they can not attach any files at all.

- Typos made on Linux system could endanger the whole code that is why Linux is considered a _**sensitive system**_.
