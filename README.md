## Growth mindset in my opinion is the ability to develop yourself through **effort** and **experince**; facing challenges and never *giving up* on your dreams.

* As for me; starting with what I am good at would be the best way to start my journy in developing myself.
* I always keep my dream of being a software developer as a huge reminder in my long journy to keep me from giving up.
* Accepting the fact that I will face many obstacles and challenges during my long journy and trying my best to keep my base.
