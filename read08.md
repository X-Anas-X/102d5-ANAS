# **Comparison and logical operators:**
- Comparison operators are used in logical statements to determine equality or difference between variables or values.
- Comparison operators can be used in conditional statements to compare values and take action depending on the result.
- var voteable = (age < 18) ? "Too young":"Old enough";  this means.. If the variable age is a value below 18, the value
  of the variable voteable will be "Too young", otherwise the value of voteable will be "Old enough".
- Comparing data of different types may give unexpected results.
- When comparing a string with a number, JavaScript will convert the string to a number when doing the comparison.
- se if to specify a block of code to be executed, if a specified condition is true
- Use else to specify a block of code to be executed, if the same condition is false
- Use else if to specify a new condition to test, if the first condition is false
- Use switch to specify many alternative blocks of code to be executed

## **For and While Loops:**
- he while loop loops through a block of code as long as a specified condition is true.. 
  for example while (condition) {
  // code block to be executed
}
- JavaScript For Loop is a Loop that can execute a block of code a number of times.
- Loops are handy, if you want to run the same code over and over again, each time with a different value.
- var i;
 for (i = 0; i < cars.length; i++) {
  text += cars[i] + "<br>";
}   is an example.
